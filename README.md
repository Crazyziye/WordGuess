# WordGuess

This is a word guessing game I developed. The primary purpose of development is to practice the use of strings.

During the development process, my imagination urged me to continue to develop, so it became a guessing game.

This is the second python game I developed. 

I upload it here because I think it can be a finished product. I also want to share my game with my friends.

There are some imperfections in the code. I will improve it in the near future.

#### There are data related to the database and api in the code. You can use it for free, but not for commercial purposes.

And you can use the database and api data in the code, but not for commercial purposes.


This game has the following characteristics.


 ## Random
 
I randomized almost all the calculations.

#### Get word

Use the random function to generate random numbers = mysql data id

#### use hint

The number of times the prompt is used = int (word length * 0.5)

#### Get letter

In the game, you can ask for the first few letters or the last few letters of a word.

The number of letters that can be viewed = int (word length * 0.45)

#### chances of guesses（unfinished）

The chances of guesses relevant to each word is different.For some reasons I have not finished it yet.

For example:

a ---> you have only one chance to guess,

opportunity ---> you will have 5 chances to guess.
